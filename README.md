# library-database
A MySQL project to mimic a library's physical inventory and users database system.

Developed as a study aide while taking "CSC 370: Database Systems" at the University of Victoria in the Fall 2021 semester. This project was not for course credit or assigned as work by the professor, but rather as a project developed to further my MySQL understanding and abilities.

This project is still in development and this document will be updated after project completion to reflect that fact. The end goal of this project is not to be a fully-operational library database system, but rather as a proof of concept to demonstrate my relational database design and MySQL skills. The database and tables will be created, sample data will populate the tables, and some sample queries will be created, but no front-end interface is slated to be developed, nor any application stress-testing as they are not needed for a project of this scope.
