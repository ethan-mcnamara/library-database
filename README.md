# library-database
A MySQL project to mimic a library's physical inventory and users database system

Developped as a study aide while taking "CSC 370: Database Systems" at the University of Victoria. This project was not for course credit or assigned as work by the professor, but rather as a project developped to further my MySQL understanding and abilities.
